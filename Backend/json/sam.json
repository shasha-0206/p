    "text": "KMIT offers a four-year under-graduate B.Tech course in Data Science. Data Science continues to evolve as one of the most promising and in-demand career paths. As the world entered the era of big data, handling it was the main challenge and concern for the enterprise industries until 2010. Unlike data in the traditional systems which was mostly structured, today most of the data is unstructured or semi-structured. A Data Scientist, according to Harvard Business Review, “is a high-ranking professional with the training and curiosity to make discoveries in the world of Big Data”. Therefore it comes as no surprise that Data Scientists are coveted professionals in the Data Analytics and IT industry. With experts predicting that 40 zettabytes of data will be in existence by 2020, Data Science career opportunities will only shoot through the roof! Shortage of skilled professionals in a world which is increasingly turning to data for decision making has also led to the huge demand for Data Scientists in start-ups as well as well-established companies. More than 50,000 jobs in the Data Science and Machine Learning are lying vacant in India, for lack of skilled professionals."

We, at KMIT, have customized it as per our needs and have been using it on multiple networks. It provides an option of two different modules. After each programming class, students are required to take a quiz which is a collection of multiple choice questions. Once they submit the quiz, they are presented with a form where they have guidelines to write code( program Eg: JAVA, C) pertaining to the class held. There are usually three programs given to the students as a part of the test. If the student is a slow learner, he/ she might be able to work on a single program. The fast learners may go to the 3rd program. Google’s platform MOODLE by itself doesn’t have the code compilation technique but we at KMIT have extended its capabilities to suffice our needs and have added code compilation techniques for JAVA, C and few other programming languages."

Borrowers are required to report any lost books immediately in writing to the Librarian; failure to do so will result in accumulating fines, and waivers for fines will not be granted. Lost books must be replaced within the permitted time. Each borrower is responsible for the books issued on their card and is therefore requested not to exchange books with others. A no-due certificate will be issued at the end of every semester. Any changes in Department, Status, or Address should be reported immediately.

It is a way of moving that uses the body as an instrument of expression and communication. Through dance, one is educated about teamwork, focus and improvisation. Hence, the initiative of creating the KMIT dance club was taken. We believe in bringing talented students across all years under one roof, on one platform. The name we chose, Mudra, is a prominent part of a dancer’s vocabulary and is one of the most significant features of Indian classical dance."

After each programming class, students are required to take a quiz which is a collection of multiple choice questions. Once they submit the quiz, they are presented with a form where they have guidelines to write code( program Eg: JAVA, C) pertaining to the class held. There are usually three programs given to the students as a part of the test. If the student is a slow learner, he/ she might be able to work on a single program. The fast learners may go to the 3rd program. Google’s platform Moodle by itself doesn’t have the code compilation technique but we at KMIT have extended its capabilities to suffice our needs and have added code compilation techniques for JAVA, C and few other programming languages."
