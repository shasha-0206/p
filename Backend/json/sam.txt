Core Values in KMIT

“A cynic is one who knows the price of everything but the value of nothing.”

Here some of the envisioned core values which not only uphold the ideals of the College but also connect with the National spirit making Higher Educational Institution a temple of learning and knowledge.

In carrying out its mission, the college is guided by the following core values:

1. Excellence and Innovation

Central to KMIT history and tradition is the commitment to teaching, to the individual learner, and to active involvement in the teaching-learning process. Highly qualified, diverse faculty of the institution promote critical thinking, engaged learning, research, and creativity in a challenging, supportive learning environment.

The professional practices of the institution are a unique fusion of education and research.

2. Equity

Consequently, it is committed to providing opportunities for personal growth in an environment that supports the development of general well being, ethical decision making, and personal responsibility. The opportunity gaps are addressed by the institution from time to time.

3. Social Responsibility

KMIT seeks to enhance interaction and understanding among diverse groups and cultivate enriched learning opportunities in a global community. The institution is dedicated to the promotion of outreach activities, community education, and partnerships with surrounding rural communities. The institution believes in collaborating with the citizens of the region, the state, the nation, and the world as well as those organizations and constituencies with whom it works.

The institution promotes a healthy and sustainable environment where the stakeholders act as moral stewards of the community and learn as responsible citizens with obligations to improve their environment.

4. Self-Esteem

It is believed in Psychology that self-esteem is the highest form of human dignity and respect that can be attained. When we look at teaching through the lens of education the one teaching that will strike us almost immediately is that of the Dignity of the *Homo Sapiens* among God’s kingdom. Dignity is one of KMIT’s core values and it is not just respecting a student but it has multiple facets that go further than manners. The institution provides resources necessary for a student to lead a life of self-esteem not just in rhetoric but in reality. It is universally believed that all these values are instrumental for development and hence are embedded in all processes in the college.

5. Academic and Personal Integrity

KMIT is committed to equity, social justice, and diversity, and maintains the highest standards of integrity in interpersonal dealings. The institution serves as a resource for and stimulus to economic, educational, cultural, environmental, and community development in the region. The institution is committed to practices that are fair, honest, and objective in dealing with students, faculty, members, staff, and stakeholders at all levels. The institution believes in being responsible and accountable in its operations at all levels including continuous assessment of academic programs and transparency in financial and administrative procedures. The good old saying that public trust cannot be won without personal integrity is adhered sincerely at KMIT.

6. Quality

KMIT provides educational programs that lead to the acquisition of knowledge and skills necessary to achieve information literacy, career advancement, personal enrichment, leadership, and service to the community. To ensure program quality, the institution assesses practices, policies, and procedures on an ongoing basis to strengthen the overall effectiveness of curriculum, instructional delivery, and operations.

The institution maintains highest academic quality and ensures that the programs remain innovative and responsive to the ever-changing and diverse needs of those it serves.

7. Diversity

KMIT sustains diversity of all forms and categories. From systemic to constitutional, these diversities thrive and add to the framework and ambience of the institution. The institution believes that diversity facilitates positive mobility and effectiveness—which are essential for creating an organizational image that every Higher Educational Institution (HEI) works for. The varied levels of diversity within an institution help in addressing issues of the job market which the students eagerly look forward at end of their program. Diversity also throws open opportunities for experimenting with innovation across the processes of the institution.

8. Empowerment

A multi-faceted approach is followed to empower all academic stakeholders through participatory administration, leadership and management. All process in the institution aim at making the *student* an empowered and highly interested stakeholder. The institution looks at ways to benchmark internal processes in order to implement improvements that enhance the overall performance.

9. Environment

KMIT strongly believes that environmental initiatives are an integral part of HEIs. The institution tries to understand the environmental policy and management dynamics from time to time before aligning the processes of the institution in accordance with the bigger picture. The indigenous social factors are thoroughly studied before the intramural strategies are formulated. The social and environment factors are jointly considered and harmonised to develop models and processes which are attainable. The institution has clear set environmental goals to not just aid in national development but also help the other Higher Educational Institutions in the vicinity consider KMIT as a model in development of green technology.

10. Engagement

It is an established truth that there should be well-directed efforts from all stakeholders to achieve a consonance between higher education and community engagement. Education cannot remain a rich man’s domain or a visionary’s dream. The fruits of its universal values should percolate from the high-end intelligentsia to the under-privileged rural youth. KMIT nurtures this idea and endeavours to reach out to the rural population through carefully designed programs that combine scientific knowledge with day-to-day utility and enhance the quality of their lives. One should remember the famous quote:

“Technology always carries the crown, but it also runs on rock, rubble and wheels.”

KMIT has several notable innovations to its credit. We have created the Tessellator (Test and collate) which has radically and dramatically enriched our Teaching learning process. Other extremely useful products we have built are “Sanjaya” app and the “Netra” app for parent and student awareness and participation. Several more products are being planned to assist and enable teaching and learning process.

One of the tools being planned is for customized education for every student. We wish to use technology to ensure that we move away from “one size fits all” philosophy of education and ensure that we created a learning environment where in every student will learn based on the students individual capabilities.

HR Policy:

Any professional institution, aspiring for growth and development in the field of education, should have a clear vision of its policies and procedures for the furtherance and fruition of its activities. Not with standing good infrastructure in terms of buildings, laboratories, staff and other amenities, over-all academic achievement will be painfully low if the procedures, duties, responsibilities and target of every member of the teaching faculty and other employees are not clearly defined and strictly adhered to.

Individuals can put in their best efforts and direct their energies to the total fulfillment of their tasks, only if their duties and responsibilities are clearly known to them. Efficient functioning, achieving the targets, building individual profiles, avoidance of confusion and creation of good rapport with colleagues are possible only if the individuals are fully aware of the procedures and policies.

CSE-DS(Data Science)/CSD:

About Data Science
The major goal of this course is to impart knowledge on techniques and theories related to data science which includes statistics, data mining, data warehousing and data visualization.

KMIT offers a four-year under-graduate B.Tech course in Data Science. Data Science continues to evolve as one of the most promising and in-demand career paths. As the world entered the era of big data, handling it was the main challenge and concern for the enterprise industries until 2010. Unlike data in the traditional systems which was mostly structured, today most of the data is unstructured or semi-structured. A Data Scientist, according to Harvard Business Review, “is a high-ranking professional with the training and curiosity to make discoveries in the world of Big Data”. Therefore it comes as no surprise that Data Scientists are coveted professionals in the Data Analytics and IT industry. With experts predicting that 40 zettabytes of data will be in existence by 2020, Data Science career opportunities will only shoot through the roof! Shortage of skilled professionals in a world which is increasingly turning to data for decision making has also led to the huge demand for Data Scientists in start-ups as well as well-established companies. More than 50,000 jobs in the Data Science and Machine Learning are lying vacant in India, for lack of skilled professionals.

Some of the features of Telescope are:

a customized version of Moodle, an open-source learning management system provided by Google.

provides an option of two different modules. After each programming class, students are required to take a quiz which is a collection of multiple-choice questions. Once they submit the quiz, they are presented with a form where they have guidelines to write code (program Eg: JAVA, C) pertaining to the class held.

usually three programs given to the students as a part of the test. If the student is a slow learner, he/ she might be able to work on a single program. The fast learners may go to the third program. Google’s platform Moodle by itself doesn’t have the code compilation technique but Telescope has been built to meet training needs and have added code compilation techniques for Javascript, Python, JAVA, C and few other programming languages.

1. Use of Technology
• Smart Classrooms Equipped with projectors, screens, and interactive boards, smart classrooms allow faculty to present dynamic multimedia content like videos, animations, and live coding demonstrations, making learning more engaging.

• Learning Management Systems (LMS) KMIT uses platforms like Tesseract, KMIT vista YouTube channel, Tessellator, kmitonline.com, Tantrik, Toofan, Prashnmanch or other LMS tools to share resources, track assignments, and engage students in discussions.

2. Active Learning Methods
• Case Studies Real-world examples and case studies are often used to relate theoretical knowledge to practical applications, enabling students to understand the relevance of what they are learning

• Problem-Based Learning (PBL): Students are presented with a problem and asked to find solutions collaboratively, enhancing their problem-solving and teamwork abilities.

3. Flipped Classroom
In a flipped classroom, students review learning materials (such as lecture videos or readings) outside of class and then engage in hands-on activities, discussions, and projects during class time. This promotes better retention of concepts and encourages peer-to-peer learning.

4. Interactive Assessments and Quizzes
Digital tools like Tessellator, Telescope, Toofan, Prashnamanch quizzes can be used to conduct interactive quizzes during lessons, helping students to test their understanding in real-time and get instant feedback

5. Industry Collaboration
KMIT might collaborate with industry professionals, offering guest lectures, workshops, or live projects that allow students to interact with experts and gain insights into current industry trends and challenges
